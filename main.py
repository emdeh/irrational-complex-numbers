'''
Animation Range and Speed: The frames parameter in FuncAnimation is  set to np.linspace(0, 20, 500), which means the animation will run from 0 to 20 seconds with 500 steps. Adjust these values to either speed up or slow down the animation or to make it run for a longer or shorter duration.

Trace Accumulation: Accumulating the trace (x_trace.append(x2); y_trace.append(y2)) ensures that the path of the end of the second arm is traced over time. This will visually represent the complex pattern created by the combined rotations.

Visualization Scaling: Set by the radii (r1, r2) (currently 3.0) and the plot limits (xlim, ylim) to Â±8. This should give a clear view of the patterns without clipping, but adjust these if you want to zoom in or out.
