# irrational-complex-numbers

I recently saw an animation on that demonstrated the concept of irrational numbers, specifically focusing on the Golden Ratio. The animation utilised a variation of Euler's formula, commonly applied in the realms of complex numbers and trigonometry. It featured a double rod pendulum swinging in continuous circles. The animation included periodic zoom-ins to illustrate that the path traced by the pendulum never repeats exactly, forming what appears to be a fractal pattern. Over time, this pattern evolved into an increasingly spherical shape.

The implication was that beauty can never be derived from perfection...I don't know about that, but it seemed like a fun thing to try and recreate and then potentially create another animation using a rational number to compare the differences.

## Setup and Installation

### Python Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### System Dependencies - Linux
If you are running the project on a Linux system, you may need to install `python3-tk` to enable graphical displays with Matplotlib. This can be installed via apt-get:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

## Running the project

```
python3 concept.py # or the main.py

```
